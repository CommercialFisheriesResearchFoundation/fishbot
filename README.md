## Fishing Industry Shared Bottom Oceanographic Timeseries

## About FIShBOT
FIShBOT is a python program deployed as a docker container on AWS lambda. The program is configured to run daily and synchronize multiple data sources and add them to the fishbot_realtime dataset dynamically. 

Before pushing the latest aggregated dataset to S3, the current publicly available FISHBOT dataset is archived. The url to access the complete dataset is available as a url in the fishbot_archive dataset. Therefore all previous versions of the dataset are accessible in a static manner for future analysis and reference. 

## Background
What is FIShBOT? Fishing Industry Shared Bottom Oceanographic Timeseries (FIShBOT) is a standardized in-situ gridded bottom temperature product derived from cooperative research data streams.
Why do we need FIShBOT? The oceanography of the northwest Atlantic is extremely dynamic. Remotely sensed products (satellite images) can only provide surface measurements of temperature and modeled bottom temperature products are often at coarse spatial scales which are not always representative of the habitats commercial species are exposed to. Researchers and the fishing community alike share the need to better understand and monitor ocean conditions in our region. 
How did we make FIShBOT? We combined in-situ bottom temperature data from three cooperative research programs that partner with commercial fishing vessels. All the data was filtered to include only records from bottom-fishing gears and standardized to a common spatial and temporal resolution. The resulting product is a daily grid where each grid cell (7km2/4.35mi2) contains the average of all the bottom temperature sensor measurements in a given day.

### Refresh Interval

Fishbot is updated dynamically based on the calendar. If a dataset is not publicly accessible at the time of program start (midnight EST) then those data will not be available in FishBot_realtime.

**Daily**, the last 5 days of data are synchronized across all available datasets.<br>
**Bi-weekly**, the last 30 days of data are synchronized across all available datasets.<br>
**Quarterly**, the last 365 days of data are synchronized across all available datasets.<br>
**Annually**, all data are completely refreshed from  all available datasets.<br>

The dynamic refresh interval balances making real-time data accessible quickly and optimizing storage and performance. The contributing groups to fishbot rely on a rolling QA/QC schedule and often receive data at intermittent intervals from the fleet. To capture the dynamic nature of data contributing to FISHBOT, the program itself must be dynamic to reflect perpetual QA/QC efforts. 
### FIShBOT Archive Citation
Each FIShBOT archive is minted a DOI for versioned citation. This is helpful if the data are incorporated into specific analysis or assessment for reproducibility. This is done automatically through the Zenodo API. The record of citations is collated in the [FIShBOT Community on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/fishbot/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10&sort=newest).
